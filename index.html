		<p>The second section talking about entropy, software rot and broken windows is something<br>
		I have definitely struggled with many times. I feel that it is all too often where<br>
		I will write nice code, but as time goes on and I become more eager to finish it, or<br>
		more tired from working on it the sloppiness of my work goes up, and as soon as one<br>
		thing is sloppy a lot of my code follows suit because I just think "well its already like this<br>
		may as well just keep going like this".</p>
