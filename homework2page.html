		<h1>homework 2</h1>
		
		<p>
		orthogonality and decoupling are things I struggle to motivate myself to do all too often. The program/language I work in the most often by far is Gamemaker,<br>
		which only implemented proper oop quite recently and is all around very strange in how it works. Before then the lack of convinient functions/methods and inheritence made<br>
		it much easier to copy lots of code, and have the various "objects" be very dependent on each other with lots of coupling and direct modification of each other's states.<br>
		Because of this I've generally just been used to writing very non-orthogonal code, since I was used to simply not having a lot of options. But now with that convinience<br>
		I still find it hard to motivate myself to actually do it when often I find myself with a number of very simple objects, with very minimal specific functionality to where<br>
		directly accessing it and not bothering trying to make it orthogonal, or duplicating it and making minor changes feels like it has no repercussions, but as time goes on<br>
		more and more of these pop up, creating a long list of smaller nonorthogonal objects/functions that I feel like could end up screwing me over in the future, but by the time I<br>
		realize how much of an affect it could really have it feels like it would be a massive undertaking to rewrite it all to be independent, but still function the same.
